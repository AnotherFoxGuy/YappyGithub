      <p>
        Yappy was built with discord.js. discord.js is a JavaScript library that wraps around the
        <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro">Discord API</a>
        so you can make your own Bots and Applications for Discord. It handles
        all the communication and provides an easy-to-use interface so you can
        focus on doing actual work.
